# Sample_FEM
A primitive FEM_code to solve laplace equation using dirichlet Boundary condition. 
It solves the potential inside a rectangluar sheet of metal, one side of the sheet of metal is maintained at a potential of 100V and the rest of the sides are grounded. A more generalised code involving user defined potential and geometry will be generated in near future. This is to illustrate the basic working of Finite Element Method in solving a Boundary value problem.
